# Hangman-Game


## Overview: 
Create a web app that features dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript code

## Technology 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Comments
* I enjoyed styling the page and making it responsive.  


## Challenges
* I figured out solutiosn to most (bit not all) of the challenges that I encounted, which was a satisfying experience. 

## Feedback and Questions
* Please comment on the general code structure. How can it be optimized?
* Is there a better way to track wins and losses to trigger the `gameEnd()`?
* How can I remove an `eventListener` in the `gameEnd()` function to prevent additional user input? When I tried using `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation`, game stopped responding to user input during the next round.
